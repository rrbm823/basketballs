A collection of functions used in the Kaggle March Madness competition

In this project I used generalized linear models and support vector machine to make predictions on the outcome of the 2013 NCAA championship.

A performance index was made by evaluating team strength based on a team's performance and their stength of schedule. Teams with tougher schedules are given a higher rating. Relevant code is in `RPI.R`

Web scraping was done to collect coaches' tournament records. Relevent code is in `scrape_TR.R`

Data munging code and model generating code can be found in `mc.R`

Also plotting code was made to visualize team RPI and game outcome. Plots are color coded to display whether an upset had occurred according to these models. Code found in `3dplots.r`

Thanks for watching!
